Exercises:

1. Create a struct called 'Matrix'. The Matrix struct has the following information:
number of rows of matrix\
number of columns of matrix\
elements of matrix (You can use 2D vector)\
The Matrix struct has methods for each of the following:
* get the number of rows
* get the number of columns
* set the elements of the matrix at a given position (i,j)
* adding two matrices. (2nd matrix can be taken as input to the method)
* print matrix structure as json
(Assume that the dimensions are correct)\
Expectation: Use structs, slices, methods

2. Create an expression tree using golang structs. For example string a + b - c on tree would look like the following
Once the tree is built, traverse the tree in preorder and postorder format and print the values.
Expectation: Use Recursion, Strings, Pointers, Struct

3. There are 3 types of employees in an organization:
Fulltime, Contractor, Freelancer\
Full-time employees are paid by the day and the Contractors are paid by the day.
Freelancers are paid by the hour.
